# Corzo
An instant-feeling payment app powered by blockchain, ## without making users deal with blockchain ##.
Send money by username or email, not wallet addresses. No gas. No token jargon. 
Under the hood, Corzo settles transfers on-chain via a gasless relayer flow and returns a real confirmation + tx hash, while the UI stays as simple as a normal fintech app.
