# Corzo

An instant-feeling payment app powered by blockchain, **without making users deal with blockchain**.

Send money by username or email, not wallet addresses. No gas. No token jargon. 
Under the hood, Corzo settles transfers on-chain via a gasless relayer flow and returns a real confirmation + tx hash, while the UI stays as simple as a normal fintech app.


## How Corzo works

1) **Sign up + verify**
- A user creates an account and verifies their email.

2) **Wallet created automatically (behind the scenes)**
- Corzo generates an EOA wallet for the user.
- The wallet address is stored in MongoDB.
- The private key is stored **encrypted** (never shown to the user).

3) **Deposit**
- When the user deposits, funds are converted into **USDT0** and held in the user’s wallet.
- To the user, it simply feels like “I deposited money into my Corzo account.”

4) **Send**
- The user enters a **username/email**.
- Corzo resolves the recipient from our database.
- Corzo submits a **gasless USDT0 transfer** via the Plasma relayer.
- The UI polls status and displays confirmation + tx hash.

5) **Withdraw**
- Corzo converts the user’s USDT0 into their chosen currency and sends it to their payout method.

## Quick Start
1) Backend (Flask)  
```bash
cd mobile-app/Backend
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # win: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export PLASMA_RELAYER_API_KEY=your-key
flask --app app.py run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5050
# backend: http://127.0.0.1:5050
```

2) Frontend (static HTML/JS)  
```bash
cd mobile-app/frontend
python3 -m http.server 8000   # or any static server, e.g. npx serve .
# open http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

3) Wallet / Plasma Testnet  
- In the browser, click “Connect Wallet” then “Switch Plasma” to add chainId 0x2612.  
- Balance reads & send page use `https://testnet-rpc.plasma.to`.

4) Optional test script  
```bash
cd mobile-app/Backend
python3 test_full_verification.py   # hits http://127.0.0.1:5050/api
```

## Cash Out Network
### Strategic Partnership Infrastructure
**Partner 1:**
- The largest pharmacy network in Latin America, providing cash-out infrastructure across the region.
- More than **9,500** Locations across Mexico, Chile, and Colombia.
A- ccessible locations in urban and rural areas

__Why this partnership works__
- Trusted brand with 25+ years in operation.
- High foot traffic and accessibility.
- Proven cash handling infrastructure.
- Extended operating hours (many 24/7).


**Partner 2:** 
- Operates a few thousand stores across Latin America and a few hundred in the U.S. 25,987 OXXO stores in its Proximity Americas division (Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and the U.S.).
- Of these, **23,206** are in Mexico as of end 2024, implying roughly **2,800–2,900** stores across the rest of the Americas.

__Why this partnership works__
- Massive daily-use footprint.
- Stores are embedded in everyday routines—high-frequency, convenience-driven traffic that is hard to replicate through digital or traditional retail alone.
- Proven operating model beyond Mexico, with thousands of stores already operating successfully across multiple Latin American markets and the U.S., OXXO has shown it can localize, scale, and execute consistently.
- Physical reach and last-mile relevance.
- The network enables fast, low friction access to consumers where they already are especially valuable for payments, pickups, services, and omnichannel strategies.
- Trusted brand at neighborhood level.
- Isn’t just big; it’s familiar. That trust lowers adoption barriers for new services introduced through the partnership.
- Room to grow internationally: While Mexico remains the core, the **~3,000** stores outside Mexico represent a meaningful and expanding platform for regional growth without starting from zero.

## Problem Statement
**Social and Economic Implications**
- 4% of GDP is remittance, on essential areas such as food, health care, education, housing.

**Slow Processing Time**
- 5 days for bank transfers, while faster transfers incur high fees.

**Unfavourable Fees**
- 9% fees, leaving much lesser for remittance recipients.


## Scale - Why this matters economically?
- Mexico receives **$66B** in remittances every year.
- **$53B** flows through the U.S. to Mexico corridor.
- That makes Mexico the **2nd** most remittance recipient globally and **1st** in Latin America.
- Even a 1% improvement in how this money moves represents a **$1.76B** opportunity while directly improving lives.

## Closing: Confidence in the Solution
**Project Goal:**
Become the most high-tech and lowest-cost operator in the cash transfer business.
 
## Milestones Achieved / In Progress
__Workstream 1__ 
**MVP Development:**
- Designed and built a minimum viable product focused on low transaction fees.
- Ensures rapid fund access for users.
__Workstream 2__
**Partnerships:**
- Collaborating with partners, local banks, microfinance institutions, and retailers.
- Preparing fundraising and financing to scale operations.
__Workstream 3__

- **Expand partnerships:** Onboard more financial and retail partners.
- **Scale reach:** Use mobile networks to reduce costs and time further.
- **Measure impact:** Track user savings, faster transfers, and fee reduction.
 
### How to Get Involved
